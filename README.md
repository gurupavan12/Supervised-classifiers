# Project 2: Supervised Classifiers
Due on Feb 12, 2017
 

# An Overview
The goal of this project is to get you familiar with common classifiers and how to compare and contrast different classifiers.  You will learn how to implement two supervised classifiers, to use Fisher projection on your data, and evaluate their performance on real data.

 

# Datasets
You will be working on three different datasets (all datasets are included in the starter code).   

WINE (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine) dataset.
Wallpaper Group Dataset - This dataset consists of the features extracted from images containing the 17 Wallpaper Groups.  These features have already been extracted for you. Here is an example of multiple patterns from one such group (specifically P4M):
 

Taiji Pose Dataset - This is a dataset of the joint angles (in quaternions) of 35 sequences from 4 people performing Taiji in our motion capture lab.  You will classify which MoCAP frames are transitional frames 7 different poses (non '0' labels) and the non-transitional frames (the '0' labels).  Here is a sample video of one of the performances: link to the video  (We are only using up to 1:30 in the video)
